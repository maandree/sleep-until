.B sleep-until
.IR clockname ...
.IR timepoint ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pause until \fItimepoint\fP. \fItimepoint\fP is the number of
seconds since Epoch, in UTC but not accounting for leap seconds,
by default. If \fIclockname\fP is specifed, \fItimepoint\fP is
the number of seconds since the zerotime of that clock.
\fItimepoint\fP may be an arbitrary floating point number.
Pause is continued when interrupted.

On Linux 4.2.2 the clocks that can be used are:
.TP

\fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fP

\fBCLOCK_MONOTONIC\fP
.TP

\fBCLOCK_BOOTTIME\fP
.TP

\fBCLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM\fP
.TP

(the proper implementation of a monotonic clock), and
\fBCLOCK_TAI\fP does not work.
