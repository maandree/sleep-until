NAME
	sleep-until â€“ sleeps until a specified time

SYNOPSIS
	sleep-until CLOCKNAME... TIMEPOINT...

DESCRIPTION
	Pause until TIMEPOINT. TIMEPOINT is the number of seconds
	since Epoch, in UTC but not accounting for leap seconds,
	by default. If CLOCKNAME is specifed, TIMEPOINT is the
	number of seconds since the zerotime of that clock.
	TIMEPOINT may be an arbitrary floating point number.
	Pause is continued when interrupted.

	On Linux 4.2.2 the clocks that can be used are:
	* CLOCK_REALTIME
	* CLOCK_MONOTONIC
	* CLOCK_BOOTTIME
	* CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM
	* CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM
	Note that the neither course clocks, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
	(the proper implementation of a monotonic clock), and
	CLOCK_TAI does not work.
